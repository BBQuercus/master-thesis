First and foremost, I would like to thank Jeff for making this project possible and keeping me (at least somewhat) on the right track and encouraging me to dive deeper into coding. 
Next, I can count myself lucky for having an awesome supervisor in Daniel who remained critical and always helpful if questions arose. 
Regarding questions..., I had a few.
And without Pratik and Franka many of those would have remained unanswered.
They gave me helpful comments on improving this very document and contributed to a pleasant lab atmosphere.
In a rather busy time, Varun was friendly enough to clone the smGFP plasmid which made me have more time to focus on other important things at hand.
Finally, a big thank you to Susan for accepting in being the official part of the university and grading this thesis.
