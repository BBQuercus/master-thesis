Stress granules are cytoplasmic, membrane-less organelles containing a plethora of proteins involved in translation initiation and repression.
They are exclusively formed in stress conditions.
This study attempts to better understand the role of stress granules by focussing on a core protein component: G3BP1.
By tethering G3BP1 to specific mRNAs, various single-molecule imaging tools were used to investigate G3BP1's effect on translation and stability.
G3BP1 appears to increase reporter protein production by a significant margin by mRNA stabilization.
Lastly, a new translation site imaging tool is presented which can be used in future studies to address the many unanswered questions.
