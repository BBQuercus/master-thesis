Stress granules are cytoplasmic, membrane-less organelles containing a plethora of proteins involved in translation initiation and repression.
They are exclusively formed in stress conditions.
This study attempts to better understand the role of stress granules by focussing on a core protein component: Ras GTPase-Activating Protein-Binding Protein 1 (G3BP1).
By tethering G3BP1 to specific mRNAs, various single-molecule imaging tools were used to investigate G3BP1's effect on translation and stability.
G3BP1 tethering yielded an increase an reporter protein levels but using the translation site imaging system SunTag no effects on translational activity were measured.
However, as shown by a TREAT assay to measure 5'-3' mRNA degradation, mRNA stability was significantly increased.
Lastly, a new translation site imaging tool using a spaghetti-monster-based structural support is presented which can be used in future studies to address many unanswered questions.
