Stress granules are cytoplasmic, membrane-less organelles containing a plethora of proteins involved in translation initiation and repression and are exclusively formed in stress conditions.
This study aimed to better understand the role of stress granules by focussing on a core protein component: Ras GTPase-Activating Protein-Binding Protein 1 (G3BP1).
By tethering G3BP1 to specific mRNAs, various single-molecule imaging tools were used to investigate G3BP1's effect on translation (SunTag) and mRNA stability (TREAT).
G3BP1 tethering yielded an increase in bulk Renilla Luciferase activity but SunTag imaging of translation showed that translation sites had similar intensities, which measures ribosome occupancy, compared to control cells.
However, as shown by a TREAT assay to measure 5$'$-3$'$ mRNA degradation, mRNA stability was significantly increased.
Lastly, an optimized version of the SunTag translation site imaging tool using a spaghetti-monster-based structural support is presented that can be used in future studies to address many unanswered questions.
