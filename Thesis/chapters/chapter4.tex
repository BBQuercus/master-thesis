The role of many SG-proteins in unstressed cells is still unclear.
An understanding of these proteins, such as G3BP1 could provide important insights into how SGs form and what functional purpose they serve.
This study approaches this mystery experimentally.

Fusing G3BP1 to MCP has profound effects on their associated reporter transcripts.
First, mRNAs are more likely to get recruited to SGs.
The nature of transient transfections used for these sets of experiments typically does not achieve complete cellular coverage.
Therefore, this likely lowering the numbers measured compared to if all cells were expressing the construct.
Furthermore, due to highly clustered mRNAs in SGs, accurate quantification was proven to be rather difficult also decreasing the number.
Second, G3BP1 has a significant effect on protein expression irrespective of cellular stress.
This interesting finding showed that the role of G3BP1 in SGs might just be secondary while it is more important function occurs in normal cell homeostasis.
As previously proposed, SGs might arise from the necessity to sequester proteins like G3BP1 from mRNA targets in the cytosol \cite{fischer_structure-mediated_2020}.
SunTag imaging experiments were performed to observe differences in translational activity.
These, however, did not show major differences suggesting that G3BP1 might only have minor roles in translational activity.
Surprisingly, TREAT assays looking at mRNA stability showed significant differences.
This suggests that G3BP1 might actively reduce 5$'$-3$'$ degradation by sequestering RNase binding sites.
Taken together, while some recent publications assume a decay promoting role of G3BP1 \cite{fischer_structure-mediated_2020, tourriere_rasgap-associated_2001}, others including this study have suggested the opposite \cite{aulas_g3bp1_2015, bley_stress_2015, laver_rna-binding_2020}.
The role of G3BP1 in mRNA metabolism remains debated and needs further clarification on a molecular level.
A similar experimental setup could be used to test other SG-proteins including TIA-1 or singular domains enriched in the SG transcriptome such as DEAD boxes.

In an effort to increase the expression levels of the currently used SunTag reporter cassette, a novel cassette relying on structural support by smGFP was created.
The preliminary results shown here suggest that single-chain antibody occupancies are comparable with the previous version while greatly increasing transcript numbers.
This seems to mainly be achieved through more translating transcripts per cell.
However, it is still unclear what the underlying cause of the poor induction of the SunTag reporter is.
The lower signal intensity has shown to make a track based analysis slightly harder.
To counteract this, one could, however, use two or more cassettes or add more repeats at other locations within the structural scaffold.
Looking forward, it would be interesting to see if mRNA stability is also affected and how the system can be evolved.
Recent progress in single-chain antibodies leads the way to a highly interchangeable system with different tags and fluorescent colors.
