\chapter{Discussion}


Fusing G3BP1 to MCP has profound effects on their attached mRNAs.
First, mRNAs are more likely to get recruited to SGs.
The nature of transient transfections used for these sets of experiments likely
    lowered the number measured if all cells were expressing the construct.
Furthermore, due to highly clustered mRNAs in SGs accurate quantification was proven to be
    rather difficult also decreasing the number.
Second, G3BP1 has a significant effect on protein expression irrespective of cellular stress.
This interesting finding showed that the role of G3BP1 in SGs might just be secondary while
    it's more important function occurs in normal cell homeostasis.
SunTag imaging experiments were performed to observe differences in translational activity.
These, however, were inconclusive and no major differences occurred suggesting that
    G3BP1 might only have minor roles in translational initiation or elongation.
Surprisingly, TREAT assays looking at mRNA stability showed significant differences.
This suggests that G3BP1 might actively reduce 5'-3' degradation by sequestering
    RNase binding sites or inhibiting RNases altogether.
Taken together, while some recent publications assume a decay promoting role of G3BP1 \cite{fischer_structure-mediated_2020, tourriere_rasgap-associated_2001},
    others including this study have suggested the opposite \cite{aulas_g3bp1_2015, bley_stress_2015, laver_rna-binding_2020}.
The role of G3BP1 in mRNA metabolism remains debated and needs further clarification on a molecular level.

In an effort to reduce the aggregation potential of the currently used SunTag reporter cassette,
    a novel cassette relying on the structural support by smGFP was created.
The preliminary results shown here suggest that binding affinities are comparable with the previous
    version while greatly increasing translational activity.
This seems to mainly be achieved through more translating transcripts per cell.
The lower signal intensity has shown to make a track based analysis slightly harder.
To counteract this, one could, however, use two or more cassettes or add more repeats at
    other locations within the structural scaffold.
Looking forward, it would be interesting to see if mRNA stability is also affected and how the
    system can be evolved.
Recent progress in single-chain antibodies lead the way to a highly interchangeable system
    with different tags and fluorescent colors.
