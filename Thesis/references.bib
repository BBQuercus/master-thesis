	abstract = {Mammalian stress granules (SGs) harbor untranslated mRNAs that accumulate in cells exposed to environmental stress. Drugs that stabilize polysomes (emetine) inhibit the assembly of SGs, whereas drugs that destabilize polysomes (puromycin) promote the assembly of SGs. Moreover, emetine dissolves preformed SGs as it promotes the assembly of polysomes, suggesting that these mRNP species (i.e., SGs and polysomes) exist in equilibrium. We used green flourescent protein–tagged SG-associated RNA-binding proteins (specifically, TIA-1 and poly[A] binding protein [PABP-I]) to monitor SG assembly, disassembly, and turnover in live cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching shows that both TIA-1 and PABP-I rapidly and continuously shuttle in and out of SGs, indicating that the assembly of SGs is a highly dynamic process. This unexpected result leads us to propose that mammalian SGs are sites at which untranslated mRNAs are sorted and processed for either reinitiation, degradation, or packaging into stable nonpolysomal mRNP complexes. A truncation mutant of TIA-1 (TIA-1ΔRRM), which acts as a transdominant inhibitor of SG assembly, promotes the expression of cotransfected reporter genes in COS transfectants, suggesting that this process of mRNA triage might, directly or indirectly, influence protein expression.},

To study how SGs bring about the massive spatial compartmentalization, we monitored the localization of various RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) targeted to SGs upon exposure to stress. We discovered that concomitant with the onset of eIF2α phosphorylation, RBPs accumulate locally in the cytoplasm, which leads to increased inter-molecular interactions and the formation of robustly detergent-resistant foci. Subsequently, microtubules (MTs) mediate 1) the ordered spatial organization of SGs and 2) the recruitment of a set of nuclear-localized SG components to the cytoplasm. Meanwhile, MTs did not appear to be required for the maintenance of SG distribution after its assembly. Our data suggest that the process of SG formation is composed of MT-independent and -dependent pathways, which take place sequentially during stress response.},

As such, SG assembly is associated with cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, ischemia, and virus infections. SGs and granule-related signaling circuits are therefore promising targets to improve therapeutic intervention for several diseases. This is clinically relevant, because pharmacological drugs can affect treatment outcome by modulating SG formation. As membraneless and highly dynamic compartments, SGs regulate translation, ribostasis and proteostasis. Moreover, they serve as signaling hubs that determine cell viability and stress recovery. Various compounds can modulate SG formation and dynamics. Rewiring cell signaling through SG manipulation thus represents a new strategy to control cell fate under various physiological and pathological conditions.},

The order of assembly and disassembly of these two structures remains unknown. Time course analysis of granule assembly suggests that core formation is an early event in granule assembly. Stress granule disassembly is also a stepwise process with shell dissipation followed by core clearance. Perturbations that alter liquid-liquid phase separations (LLPS) driven by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDR) of RNA binding proteins in vitro have the opposite effect on stress granule assembly in vivo. Taken together, these observations argue that stress granules assemble through a multistep process initiated by stable assembly of untranslated mRNPs into core structures, which could provide sufficient high local concentrations to allow for a localized LLPS driven by IDRs on RNA binding proteins., DOI:

The stress response in eukaryotic cells often inhibits translation initiation and leads to the formation of cytoplasmic RNA-protein complexes referred to as stress granules. Stress granules contain nontranslating mRNAs, translation initiation components, and many additional proteins affecting mRNA function. Stress granules have been proposed to affect mRNA translation and stability and have been linked to apoptosis and nuclear processes. Stress granules also interact with P-bodies, another cytoplasmic RNP granule containing nontranslating mRNA, translation repressors, and some mRNA degradation machinery. Together, stress granules and P-bodies reveal a dynamic cycle of distinct biochemical and compartmentalized mRNPs in the cytosol, with implications for the control of mRNA function.},

Interactions between prion-related domains and intrinsically disordered protein regions found in SG-nucleating proteins promote the condensation of ribonucleoproteins into SGs. We propose that PIC components, especially 40S ribosomes and mRNA, recruit nucleators that trigger SG condensation. With resolution of stress, translation reinitiation reverses this process and SGs disassemble. By cooperatively modulating the assembly and disassembly of SGs, ribonucleoprotein condensation can influence the survival and recovery of cells exposed to unfavorable environmental conditions.},

Mobilization of a Mos1 transposon generates a double strand break in non-coding DNA. The break is repaired by copying DNA from an extrachromosomal template into the chromosomal site. Homozygous single copy insertions can be obtained in less than two weeks by injecting approximately twenty animals. We have successfully inserted transgenes as long as 9 kb and verified that single copies are inserted at the targeted site. Single copy transgenes are expressed at endogenous levels and can be expressed in the female and male germlines.},

Progress has been made on a third, complementary treatment approach that aims to protect oligodendrocytes-and the myelin they generate and maintain-from inflammation-mediated death by enhancing the integrated stress response. Studies in cells and in mouse models of multiple sclerosis have shown that this innate protective pathway, which maintains proteostasis, can be harnessed effectively to protect oligodendrocytes and myelin during inflammation. With one drug already in clinical development for patients with multiple sclerosis, and several potential therapies under investigation, modulation of the integrated stress response might become an important component of strategies to halt the progression of the disease.},

	abstract = {APOBEC3G is an antiviral host factor capable of inhibiting the replication of both exogenous and endogenous retroviruses as well as hepatitis B, a DNA virus that replicates through an RNA intermediate. To gain insight into the mechanism whereby APOBEC3G restricts retroviral replication, we investigated the subcellular localization of the protein. Herein, we report that APOBEC3G localizes to mRNA processing (P) bodies, cytoplasmic compartments involved in the degradation and storage of nontranslating mRNAs. Biochemical analysis revealed that APOBEC3G localizes to a ribonucleoprotein complex with other P-body proteins which have established roles in cap-dependent translation (eIF4E and eIF4E-T), translation suppression (RCK/p54), RNA interference–mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing (AGO2), and decapping of mRNA (DCP2). Similar analysis with other APOBEC3 family members revealed a potential link between the localization of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F to a common ribonucleoprotein complex and P-bodies with potent anti–HIV-1 activity. In addition, we present evidence suggesting that an important role for HIV-1 Vif, which subverts both APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F antiviral function by inducing their degradation, could be to selectively remove these proteins from and/or restrict their localization to P-bodies. Taken together, the results of this study reveal a novel link between innate immunity against retroviruses and P-bodies suggesting that APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F could function in the context of P-bodies to restrict HIV-1 replication.},

We discovered that ataxin-2-like associates with known interaction partners of ataxin-2, the RNA helicase DDX6 and the poly(A)-binding protein, and with ataxin-2 itself. Furthermore, we found that ataxin-2-like is a component of stress granules. Interestingly, sole ataxin-2-like overexpression led to the induction of stress granules, while a reduction of stress granules was detected in case of a low ataxin-2-like level. Finally, we observed that overexpression of ataxin-2-like as well as its reduction has an impact on the presence of microscopically visible processing bodies. Thus, our results imply a functional overlap between ataxin-2-like and ataxin-2, and further indicate a role for ataxin-2-like in the regulation of stress granules and processing bodies.},

Phase transitions driven by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) have emerged as a ubiquitous mechanism for assembling liquid-like RNA/protein (RNP) bodies and other membrane-less organelles. However, a lack of tools to control intracellular phase transitions limits our ability to understand their role in cell physiology and disease. Here, we introduce an optogenetic platform that uses light to activate IDR-mediated phase transitions in living cells. We use this “optoDroplet” system to study condensed phases driven by the IDRs of various RNP body proteins, including FUS, DDX4, and HNRNPA1. Above a concentration threshold, these constructs undergo light-activated phase separation, forming spatiotemporally definable liquid optoDroplets. FUS optoDroplet assembly is fully reversible even after multiple activation cycles. However, cells driven deep within the phase boundary form solid-like gels that undergo aging into irreversible aggregates. This system can thus elucidate not only physiological phase transitions but also their link to pathological aggregates.},

Disturbances in SG dynamics have been implicated as a primary driver of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), suggesting the hypothesis that these diseases reflect an underlying disturbance in the dynamics and material properties of SGs. However, this concept has remained largely untestable in available models of SG assembly, which require the confounding variable of exogenous stressors. Here we introduce a light-inducible SG system, termed OptoGranules, based on optogenetic multimerization of G3BP1, which is an essential scaffold protein for SG assembly. In this system, which permits experimental control of SGs in living cells in the absence of exogenous stressors, we demonstrate that persistent or repetitive assembly of SGs is cytotoxic and is accompanied by the evolution of SGs to cytoplasmic inclusions that recapitulate the pathology of ALS-FTD.

Here we demonstrate that this link occurs through direct binding of 53BP1 and Crb2 to histone H4. Using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that, despite low amino acid sequence conservation, both 53BP1 and Crb2 contain tandem tudor domains that interact with histone H4 specifically dimethylated at Lys20 (H4-K20me2). The structure of 53BP1/H4-K20me2 complex uncovers a unique five-residue 53BP1 binding cage, remarkably conserved in the structure of Crb2, that best accommodates a dimethyllysine but excludes a trimethyllysine, thus explaining the methylation state-specific recognition of H4-K20. This study reveals an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism of targeting DNA repair proteins to DSBs by direct recognition of H4-K20me2.},

	abstract = {Our previous work has demonstrated that the Tudor domain of the 'survival of motor neuron' protein and the Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3) are highly similar and that they both have the ability to interact with arginine-methylated polypeptides. TDRD3 has been identified among genes whose overexpression has a strong predictive value for poor prognosis of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers, although its precise function remains unknown. TDRD3 is a modular protein, and in addition to its Tudor domain, it harbors a putative nucleic acid recognition motif and a ubiquitin-associated domain. We report here that TDRD3 localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm, where it co-sediments with the fragile X mental retardation protein on actively translating polyribosomes. We also demonstrate that TDRD3 accumulates into stress granules (SGs) in response to various cellular stresses. Strikingly, the Tudor domain of TDRD3 was found to be both required and sufficient for its recruitment to SGs, and the methyl-binding surface in the Tudor domain is important for this process. Pull down experiments identified five novel TDRD3 interacting partners, most of which are potentially methylated RNA-binding proteins. Our findings revealed that two of these proteins, SERPINE1 mRNA-binding protein 1 and DEAD/H box-3 (a gene often deleted in Sertoli-cell-only syndrome), are also novel constituents of cytoplasmic SGs. Taken together, we report the first characterization of TDRD3 and its functional interaction with at least two proteins implicated in human genetic diseases and present evidence supporting a role for arginine methylation in the regulation of SG dynamics.},

In SGs, mRNAs are stored in an abortive translation initiation complex that can be routed to either translation initiation or degradation. Here, we show that G3BP, a phosphorylation-dependent endoribonuclease that interacts with RasGAP, is recruited to SGs in cells exposed to arsenite. G3BP may thus determine the fate of mRNAs during cellular stress. Remarkably, SG assembly can be either dominantly induced by G3BP overexpression, or on the contrary, inhibited by expressing a central domain of G3BP. This region binds RasGAP and contains serine 149, whose dephosphorylation is induced by arsenite treatment. Critically, a phosphomimetic mutant (S149E) fails to oligomerize and to assemble SGs, whereas a nonphosphorylatable G3BP mutant (S149A) does both. These results suggest that G3BP is an effector of SG assembly, and that Ras signaling contributes to this process by regulating G3BP dephosphorylation.},

MK-STYX is catalytically inactive due to the absence of two amino acids from the signature motif that are essential for phosphatase activity. The nucleophilic cysteine residue and the adjacent histidine residue, which are conserved in all active dual-specificity phosphatases, are replaced by serine and phenylalanine residues respectively in MK-STYX. Mutations to introduce histidine and cysteine residues into the active site of MK-STYX generated an active phosphatase. Using MS, we identified G3BP1 [Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) SH3 (Src homology 3) domain-binding protein-1], a regulator of Ras signalling, as a binding partner of MK-STYX. We observed that G3BP1 bound to native MK-STYX; however, binding to the mutant catalytically active form of MK-STYX was dramatically reduced. G3BP1 is also an RNA-binding protein with endoribonuclease activity that is recruited to 'stress granules' after stress stimuli. Stress granules are large subcellular structures that serve as sites of mRNA sorting, in which untranslated mRNAs accumulate. We have shown that expression of MK-STYX inhibited stress granule formation induced either by aresenite or expression of G3BP itself; however, the catalytically active mutant MK-STYX was impaired in its ability to inhibit G3BP-induced stress granule assembly. These results reveal a novel facet of the function of a member of the PTP family, illustrating a role for MK-STYX in regulating the ability of G3BP1 to integrate changes in growth-factor stimulation and environmental stress with the regulation of protein synthesis.},

	abstract = {Activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) by a variety of stresses triggers phosphorylation of the α-subunit of translation initiation factor eIF2. P-eIF2α inhibits eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor that recycles inactive eIF2•GDP to active eIF2•GTP. eIF2 phosphorylation thereby represses translation. Persistent activation of the ISR has been linked to the development of several neurological disorders, and modulation of the ISR promises new therapeutic strategies. Recently, a small-molecule ISR inhibitor (ISRIB) was identified that rescues translation in the presence of P-eIF2α by facilitating the assembly of more active eIF2B. ISRIB enhances cognitive memory processes and has therapeutic effects in brain-injured mice without displaying overt side effects. While using ISRIB to investigate the ISR in picornavirus-infected cells, we observed that ISRIB rescued translation early in infection when P-eIF2α levels were low, but not late in infection when P-eIF2α levels were high. By treating cells with varying concentrations of poly(I:C) or arsenite to induce the ISR, we provide additional proof that ISRIB is unable to inhibit the ISR when intracellular P-eIF2α concentrations exceed a critical threshold level. Together, our data demonstrate that the effects of pharmacological activation of eIF2B are tuned by P-eIF2α concentration. Thus, ISRIB can mitigate undesirable outcomes of low-level ISR activation that may manifest neurological disease but leaves the cytoprotective effects of acute ISR activation intact. The insensitivity of cells to ISRIB during acute ISR may explain why ISRIB does not cause overt toxic side effects in vivo.},

First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis.

The widespread presence of germ granules across species and the associated germ line defects when germ granules are compromised suggest that germ granules are key determinants of the identity and special properties of germ cells. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been a very fruitful model system for the study of germ granules, wherein they are referred to as P granules. P granules contain a heterogeneous mixture of RNAs and proteins. To date, most of the known germ granule proteins across species, and all of the known P granule components in C elegans, are associated with RNA metabolism, which suggests that a main function of germ granules is posttranscriptional regulation. Here we review P granule structure and localization, P granule composition, the genetic pathway of P granule assembly, and the consequences in the germ line when P granule components are lost.

We use these hybrid donors to introduce fluorescent protein tags into multiple loci achieving editing efficiencies that approach those previously obtained only with much shorter ssODN donors.

Together with recent innovative imaging studies, these new data show that mammalian PBs are primarily involved not in RNA decay but rather in the coordinated storage of mRNAs encoding regulatory functions. These small cytoplasmic droplets could thus be important for cell adaptation to the environment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While the basic physical principles of 'super-resolution' imaging were discovered in the 1990s, with initial experimental demonstrations following in 2000, the broad application of super-resolution imaging to address cell-biological questions has only more recently emerged. Nanoscopy approaches have begun to facilitate discoveries in cell biology and to add new knowledge. One current direction for method improvement is the ambition to quantitatively account for each molecule under investigation and assess true molecular colocalization patterns via multi-colour analyses. In pursuing this goal, the labelling of individual molecules to enable their visualization has emerged as a central challenge. Extending nanoscale imaging into (sliced) tissue and whole-animal contexts is a further goal.

	abstract = {Stress granules are non-membranous assemblies of mRNA and protein that form in response to a variety of stressors. Genetic, pathologic, biophysical and cell biological studies have implicated disturbances in the dynamics of membrane-less organelles, such as stress granules, as a pathobiological component of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This confluence of evidence has inspired the hypothesis that these diseases reflect an underlying disturbance in the dynamics and material properties of stress granules; however, this concept has remained largely untestable in available models of stress granule assembly, which require the confounding variable of exogenous stressors. Here we demonstrate the development and use of a light-inducible stress granule system, termed OptoGranules, which permits discrete, experimental control of the dynamics and material properties of stress granules in living cells in the absence of exogenous stressors. The nucleator in this system is Opto-G3BP1, a light-sensitive chimeric protein assembled from the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and RNA-binding domain of G3BP1 combined with the light-sensitive oligomerization domain of Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) photolyase homology region (PHR). Upon stimulation with blue light, Opto-G3BP1 initiates the rapid assembly of dynamic, cytoplasmic, liquid granules that are composed of canonical stress granule components, including G3BP1, PABP, TIA1, TIAR, eIF4G, eIF3η, ataxin 2, GLE1, TDP-43 and polyadenylated RNA. With this system, we demonstrate that persistent or repetitive assembly of stress granules is cytotoxic and is accompanied by the evolution of stress granules to neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions that recapitulate the pathology of ALS-FTD.},

It is well established that mRNAs encoding secretory or membrane-bound proteins are translated on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The extent to which mRNAs that encode cytosolic proteins associate with the ER, however, remains controversial. To address this question, we quantified the number of cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs that co-localize with the ER using single-molecule RNA imaging in fixed and living cells. We found that a small but significant number of mRNAs that encode cytosolic proteins associate with the ER and show that this interaction is translation dependent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cytosolic protein-encoding transcripts can remain on the ER with dwell times consistent with multiple rounds of translation and have higher ribosome occupancies than transcripts translated in the cytosol. These results advance our understanding of the diversity and dynamics of localized translation on the ER.},

The gene expression program activated by the ISR optimizes the cellular response to stress and is dependent on the cellular context, as well as on the nature and intensity of the stress stimuli.

SGs form when stress-activated pathways stall translation initiation but allow elongation and termination to occur normally, resulting in a sudden excess of mRNPs that are spatially condensed into discrete foci by protein:protein, protein:RNA, and RNA:RNA interactions. In contrast, PBs can exist in the absence of stress, when specific factors promote mRNA deadenylation, condensation, and sequestration from the translational machinery.

Using this method, we measured mRNA decay in single cells and found that individual degradation events occur independently within the cytosol and are not enriched within processing bodies. We show that slicing of an mRNA targeted for endonucleolytic cleavage by the RNA-induced silencing complex can be observed in real time in living cells.

Signals in many biological processes can be amplified by recruiting multiple copies of regulatory proteins to a site of action. Harnessing this principle, we have developed a protein scaffold, a repeating peptide array termed SunTag, which can recruit multiple copies of an antibody-fusion protein. We show that the SunTag can recruit up to 24 copies of GFP, thereby enabling long-term imaging of single protein molecules in living cells. We also use the SunTag to create a potent synthetic transcription factor by recruiting multiple copies of a transcriptional activation domain to a nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas9 protein and demonstrate strong activation of endogenous gene expression and re-engineered cell behavior with this system. Thus, the SunTag provides a versatile platform for multimerizing proteins on a target protein scaffold and is likely to have many applications in imaging and controlling biological outputs.},

When combined with the orthogonal SunTag system, the MoonTag enables dual readouts of translation, greatly expanding the possibilities to interrogate complex translational heterogeneity. By placing MoonTag and SunTag sequences in different translation reading frames, each driven by distinct translation start sites, start site selection of individual ribosomes can be visualized in real-time. We find that start site selection is largely stochastic, but that the probability of using a particular start site differs among mRNA molecules, and can be dynamically regulated over time.

Regulation of mRNA translation, the process by which ribosomes decode mRNAs into polypeptides, is used to tune cellular protein levels. Currently, methods for observing the complete process of translation from single mRNAs in vivo are unavailable. Here, we report the long-term ({\textgreater}1 hr) imaging of single mRNAs undergoing hundreds of rounds of translation in live cells, enabling quantitative measurements of ribosome initiation, elongation, and stalling. This approach reveals a surprising heterogeneity in the translation of individual mRNAs within the same cell, including rapid and reversible transitions between a translating and non-translating state. Applying this method to the cell-cycle gene Emi1, we find strong overall repression of translation initiation by specific 5′ UTR sequences, but individual mRNA molecules in the same cell can exhibit dramatically different translational efficiencies. The ability to observe translation of single mRNA molecules in live cells provides a powerful tool to study translation regulation.},

This addition of two carbon atoms doubles the quantum efficiency and improves the photon yield of the dye in applications ranging from in vitro single-molecule measurements to super-resolution imaging.

It uses an explicit spline representation of the images in conjunction with spline processing, and is based on a coarse-to-fine iterative strategy (pyramid approach). The minimization is performed according to a new variation (ML*) of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for nonlinear least-square optimization. The geometric deformation model is a global three-dimensional (3-D) affine transformation that can be optionally restricted to rigid-body motion (rotation and translation), combined with isometric scaling. It also includes an optional adjustment of image contrast differences. We obtain excellent results for the registration of intramodality positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We conclude that the multiresolution refinement strategy is more robust than a comparable single-stage method, being less likely to be trapped into a false local optimum. In addition, our improved version of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm is faster.},

This motif, with beta-structure on the outside and alpha-helix on the inside, represents a new protein fold, which we have named the beta-can. Two protomers pack closely together to form a dimer in the crystal. The fluorophores are protected inside the cylinders, and their structures are consistent with the formation of aromatic systems made up of Tyr66 with reduction of its C alpha-C beta bond coupled with cyclization of the neighboring glycine and serine residues. The environment inside the cylinder explains the effects of many existing mutants of GFP and suggests specific side chains that could be modified to change the spectral properties of GFP.

Rescue experiments using G3BP1 mutants show that phosphomimetic G3BP1-S149E fails to rescue SG formation, whereas G3BP1-F33W, a mutant unable to bind G3BP partner proteins Caprin1 or USP10, rescues SG formation. Caprin1/USP10 binding to G3BP is mutually exclusive: Caprin binding promotes, but USP10 binding inhibits, SG formation. G3BP interacts with 40S ribosomal subunits through its RGG motif, which is also required for G3BP-mediated SG formation. We propose that G3BP mediates the condensation of SGs by shifting between two different states that are controlled by the phosphorylation of S149 and by binding to Caprin1 or USP10.},

	abstract = {Ras-GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain)-binding proteins (G3BPs, also known as Rasputin) are a family of RNA binding proteins that regulate gene expression in response to environmental stresses by controlling mRNA stability and translation. G3BPs appear to facilitate this activity through their role in stress granules for which they are considered a core component, however, it should be noted that not all stress granules contain G3BPs and this appears to be contextual depending on the environmental stress and the cell type. Although the role of G3BPs in stress granules appears to be one of its major roles, data also strongly suggests that they interact with mRNAs outside of stress granules to regulate gene expression. G3BPs have been implicated in several diseases including cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis as well as virus survival. There is now a body of evidence that suggests targeting of G3BPs could be explored as a form of cancer therapeutic. This review discusses the important discoveries and advancements made in the field of G3BPs biology over the last two decades including their roles in RNA stability, translational control of cellular transcripts, stress granule formation, cancer progression and its interactions with viruses during infection. An emerging theme for G3BPs is their ability to regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli, disease progression and virus infection making it an intriguing target for disease therapies.},

We have found that the assembly of TIA-1/R+ SGs is initiated by the phosphorylation of eIF-2α. A phosphomimetic eIF-2α mutant (S51D) induces the assembly of SGs, whereas a nonphosphorylatable eIF-2α mutant (S51A) prevents the assembly of SGs. The ability of a TIA-1 mutant lacking its RNA-binding domains to function as a transdominant inhibitor of SG formation suggests that this RNA-binding protein acts downstream of the phosphorylation of eIF-2α to promote the sequestration of untranslated mRNAs at SGs.

	abstract = {Arthropod-borne flaviviruses (FVs) are a growing world-wide health threat whose incidence and range are increasing. The pathogenicity and cytopathicity of these single-stranded RNA viruses are influenced by viral subgenomic non-protein-coding RNAs (sfRNAs) that the viruses produce to high levels during infection. To generate sfRNAs the virus co-opts the action of the abundant cellular exonuclease Xrn1, which is part of the cell's normal RNA turnover machinery. This exploitation of the cellular machinery is enabled by discrete, highly structured, Xrn1-resistant RNA elements (xrRNAs) in the 3'UTR that interact with Xrn1 to halt processive 5' to 3' decay of the viral genomic RNA. We recently solved the crystal structure of a functional xrRNA, revealing a novel fold that provides a mechanistic model for Xrn1 resistance. Continued analysis and interpretation of the structure reveals that the tertiary contacts that knit the xrRNA fold together are shared by a wide variety of arthropod-borne FVs, conferring robust Xrn1 resistance in all tested. However, there is some variability in the structures that correlates with unexplained patterns in the viral 3' UTRs. Finally, examination of these structures and their behavior in the context of viral infection leads to a new hypothesis linking RNA tertiary structure, overall 3' UTR architecture, sfRNA production, and host adaptation.},

Sequence-specific features within the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) often direct mRNAs for decay. Here, we characterize a genome-wide RNA decay pathway that reduces the half-lives of mRNAs based on overall 3′ UTR structure formed by base pairing. The decay pathway is independent of specific single-stranded sequences, as regulation is maintained in both the original and reverse complement orientation. Regulation can be compromised by reducing the overall structure by fusing the 3′ UTR with an unstructured sequence. Mutating base-paired RNA regions can also compromise this structure-mediated regulation, which can be restored by re-introducing base-paired structures of different sequences. The decay pathway requires the RNA-binding protein UPF1 and its associated protein G3BP1. Depletion of either protein increased steady-state levels of mRNAs with highly structured 3′ UTRs as well as highly structured circular RNAs. This structure-dependent mechanism therefore enables cells to selectively regulate coding and noncoding RNAs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {G3BP RNA-binding proteins are important components of stress granules (SGs). Here, we analyze the role of the Drosophila G3BP Rasputin (RIN) in unstressed cells, where RIN is not SG associated. Immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis identifies over 550 mRNAs that copurify with RIN. The mRNAs found in SGs are long and translationally silent. In contrast, we find that RIN-bound mRNAs, which encode core components of the transcription, splicing, and translation machinery, are short, stable, and highly translated. We show that RIN is associated with polysomes and provide evidence for a direct role for RIN and its human homologs in stabilizing and upregulating the translation of their target mRNAs. We propose that when cells are stressed, the resulting incorporation of RIN/G3BPs into SGs sequesters them away from their short target mRNAs. This would downregulate the expression of these transcripts, even though they are not incorporated into stress granules.},

	abstract = {During cellular stress, protein synthesis is severely reduced and bulk mRNA is recruited to stress granules (SGs). Previously, we showed that the SG-recruited IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) interferes with target mRNA degradation during cellular stress. Whether this requires the formation of SGs remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the sustained inhibition of visible SGs requires the concomitant knockdown of TIA1, TIAR and G3BP1. FRAP and photo-conversion studies, however, indicate that these proteins only transiently associate with SGs. This suggests that instead of forming a rigid scaffold for mRNP recruitment, TIA proteins and G3BP1 promote SG-formation by constantly replenishing mRNPs. In contrast, RNA-binding proteins like IGF2BP1 or HUR, which are dispensable for SG-assembly, are stably associated with SGs and the IGF2BP1/HUR-G3BP1 association is increased during stress. The depletion of IGF2BP1 enhances the degradation of target mRNAs irrespective of inhibiting SG-formation, whereas the turnover of bulk mRNA remains unaffected when SG-formation is impaired. Together these findings indicate that the stabilization of mRNAs during cellular stress is facilitated by the formation of stable mRNPs, which are recruited to SGs by TIA proteins and/or G3BP1. Importantly, however, the aggregation of mRNPs to visible SGs is dispensable for preventing mRNA degradation.},

While stress-induced translational repression and recruitment of key SG proteins was undisturbed, depletion of G3BP1 or its upstream regulator TDP-43 disturbed normal interactions between SGs and processing bodies (PBs). This was concomitant with decreased SG size, reduced SG–PB docking, and impaired preservation of polyadenylated mRNA. Reintroduction of G3BP1 alone was sufficient to rescue all of these phenotypes, indicating that G3BP1 is essential for normal SG–PB interactions and SG function.},

	abstract = {Mitogen activation of mRNA decay pathways likely involves specific endoribonucleases, such as G3BP, a phosphorylation-dependent endoribonuclease that associates with RasGAP in dividing but not quiescent cells. G3BP exclusively cleaves between cytosine and adenine (CA) after a specific interaction with RNA through the carboxyl-terminal RRM-type RNA binding motif. Accordingly, G3BP is tightly associated with a subset of poly(A)+ mRNAs containing its high-affinity binding sequence, such as the c-myc mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, c-myc mRNA decay is delayed in RasGAP-deficient fibroblasts, which contain a defective isoform of G3BP that is not phosphorylated at serine 149. A G3BP mutant in which this serine is changed to alanine remains exclusively cytoplasmic, whereas a glutamate for serine substitution that mimics the charge of a phosphorylated serine is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, a growth factor-induced change in mRNA decay may be modulated by the nuclear localization of a site-specific endoribonuclease such as G3BP.},

Although the function of SGs remains largely unknown, it is widely assumed they contain exclusively non-translating mRNA. Here we re-examine this hypothesis using single-molecule imaging of mRNA translation in living cells. While our data confirms that non-translating mRNAs are preferentially recruited to SGs, we find unequivocal evidence for translation of mRNA localized to SGs. Our data indicate that SG-associated translation is not rare and that the entire translation cycle (initiation, elongation and termination) can occur for these transcripts. Furthermore, translating mRNAs can be observed transitioning between the cytosol and SGs without changing their translational status. Together, these results argue against a direct role for SGs in inhibition of mRNA translation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This suggests an emerging model of cytoplasmic mRNA function in which the rates of translation and degradation of mRNAs are influenced by a dynamic equilibrium between polysomes and the mRNPs seen in P bodies. Moreover, some mRNA-specific regulatory factors, including miRNAs and RISC, appear to repress translation and promote decay by recruiting P body components to individual mRNAs.},

By sequencing the ends of 5' phosphorylated mRNA degradation intermediates, we obtain a genome-wide drug-free measurement of ribosome dynamics. We identify general translation termination pauses in both normal and stress conditions. In addition, we describe novel codon-specific ribosomal pausing sites in response to oxidative stress that are dependent on the RNase Rny1.

PBs and SGs are able to release mRNAs thus allowing their translation. PBs are constitutive, but respond to stimuli that affect mRNA translation and decay, whereas SGs are specifically induced upon cellular stress, which triggers a global translational silencing by several pathways, including phosphorylation of the key translation initiation factor elF2alpha, and tRNA cleavage among others. PBs and SGs with different composition may coexist in a single cell. These macromolecular aggregates are highly conserved through evolution, from unicellular organisms to vertebrate neurons. Their dynamics is regulated by several signaling pathways, and depends on microfilaments and microtubules, and the cognate molecular motors myosin, dynein, and kinesin. SGs share features with aggresomes and related aggregates of unfolded proteins frequently present in neurodegenerative diseases, and may play a role in the pathology. Virus infections may induce or impair SG formation. Besides being important for mRNA regulation upon stress, SGs modulate the signaling balancing apoptosis and cell survival. Finally, the formation of nuclear stress bodies (nSBs), which share components with SGs, and the assembly of additional cytosolic aggregates containing RNA—the UV granules and the Ire1 foci—, all them induced by specific cell damage factors, contribute to cell survival.},
